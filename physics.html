                    To be able to model frost formation, it is important to
                    first understand the physics behind how these frost
                    particles form in nature. In a recent
                    review\cite{frostFormation}, this physics is presented and
                    the condensation frosting process is broken into 5 stages:
                    (i) supercooled condensation, (ii) onset of freezing, (iii)
                    frost halos, (iv) interdroplet ice bridging and dry zones,
                    and (v) percolation clusters and frost densification.

                    Note that while these stages are being described separately,
                    a lot of these processes happen in parallel rather than
                    sequentially.

                    For frost formation to begin, there must be a surface with
                    water vapors surrounding it. The temperature of the surface
                    must be below the dew point, which is the temperature at
                    which water condenses. However, this is not a sufficient
                    condition; condensation involves the formation of new
                    interfaces, which needs a certain degree of supersaturation
                    in the surrounding air. This necessary condition can be
                    mathematically calculated using the principles of
                    thermodynamics and estimating the Gibbs free energy. This
                    can be interpreted as subcooling, or simply a temperature
                    lower than the dew point. There is also a possibility of
                    desublimation, where the water vapor directly freezes to ice
                    and skips the liquid condensation  stage.

                    Once water droplets start to form and grow, the distance
                    between neighboring water droplets decreases and their vapor
                    profiles start to overlap as shown in figure
                    \ref{fig:stage-1}. This results in a temporary decrease in
                    the rate of water droplet growth. However, as the droplets
                    keep growing they start to merge or coalesce. A large number
                    of coalescence events results in the formation of thin water
                    layer and accelerated growth.

                    Now, we zoom into a single water droplet to understand how
                    the freezing process begins. Just like the condensation
                    process, the temperature needs to be below the freezing
                    point, but that is not a sufficient condition by itself. A
                    certain degree of subcooling is necessary for the formation
                    of new interfaces, which can be calculated using the Gibbs
                    free energy. 

                    The freezing inside the droplets begins as a probabilistic
                    nucleation event. When a large number of these embryo form,
                    it results in a large release of latent heat, and this stage
                    is called recalescence. The droplets is now a mixture of
                    frozen nuclei and liquid water, and is analogous to an
                    \textit{ice slushy}. This stage is followed by a freeze
                    front propagation, which starts from the solid surface where
                    the water droplet is attached and moves away towards the
                    air. This typically ends in a pointy tip. This process is
                    illustrated in figure \ref{fig:stage-2}.

                    An interesting phenomenon observed during the formation of
                    frost is halos around the droplets during the recalescence
                    stage. As we know, in this stage, the temperature of the
                    droplet increases to the freezing temperature, and this
                    results in some water vapor escaping the droplets. Given the
                    right thermodynamic conditions, these micro droplets can
                    condense on the surface around the \textit{ice slushy},
                    forming a ring or halo of liquid water. It is also possible
                    that the water vapor desublimes to form an ice halo.
                    Although this is mathematically possible, these
                    desublimation halos are yet to be verified experimentally.
                    Figure \ref{fig:stage-3} shows this process of formation of
                    frost halos.

                    As water droplets, the vapor pressure in the neighboring
                    region decreases. Due to this, they pull water vapor from
                    neighboring droplets which are still in the recalescence
                    stage, which are releasing water vapors for the frost halos.
                    When this flow of water vapor from the recalescence to ice
                    droplets touches the ice, it results in immediate freezing
                    of the the water vapor and the recalescence droplet. This
                    phenomenon is referred to as ice bridging, and it causes an
                    accelerated growth of ice formation.

                    As the water vapors move towards the ice particles, it is
                    also possible that the recalescence droplets evaporates
                    completely before the water vapors reach the ice. This
                    causes the formation of dry zones at the location of the
                    recalescence droplet, which are devoid of water and water
                    vapor.

                    The ice bridging phenomena discussed before results in a
                    chain reaction as more and more ice droplets are formed. The
                    phenomenon percolates through the entire cluster forming ice
                    bridges or dry regions depending on whether these bridging
                    attempts succeed or not. Once an interconnected ice network
                    is formed throughout the cluster, water vapor can now
                    condense outside the plane on top of the droplets. This
                    increases the mass and, hence, density of the frost
                    particles. These two phenomena are shown in figure
                    \ref{fig:stage-5}.
