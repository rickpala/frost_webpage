                        Throughout this paper, the underlying physics for frost
                        formation on a microstructured surface is explained.
                        Then two Monte-Carlo simulations of frost spreading on
                        micropillar surfaces were developed to recover
                        experimental results of frost formation in different
                        regimes of temperature and humidity. The first model was
                        inspired by Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) and send
                        out random walkers one at a time; the second model
                        vectorized this algorithm and sped up the computational
                        times for the pattern formation. Ultimately, the results
                        were able to replicate the experimental results in
                        different regimes by tweaking parameters that described
                        the probability of a random walker freezing or drying.

                    Frost nucleation and spreading on solid surfaces is a common
                    process which is of interest and concern in everyday life;
                    thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms involved
                    in frost spreading. While this process is difficult to
                    quantify on unstructured surfaces, growth of frost on
                    microstructured surfaces is easier to quantify and model.
                    Recent papers (\cite{frostFormation}, \cite{PREFrosting})
                    have considered frosting on such surfaces experimentally.
                    One novel finding that was reported in these papers is that
                    there are different regimes of frost growth that are
                    characterized by the surface temperature and the relative
                    humidity of the environment. For intermediate humidity, it
                    appears that the frost growth is fractal.

                    For example, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hauerSpreading},
                    different regimes cause different patterns to form. In
                    Section \ref{section:physics}, the underlying physical
                    mechanism will be described for why patterns such as these
                    occur, however to gain intuition into these shapes, it is
                    relatively simple to understand. In each of these runs, the
                    surface temperature is the same; the only thing that is
                    changing is the relative humidity of the air above the
                    microstructured surface. As the humidity increases, the
                    amount of surface area that the frost particles cover grows;
                    furthermore, the shape becomes rounder and rounder and
                    ultimately overtakes most of the domain.

                                result in different shapes. All three runs are
                                kept at \(T_{\mathrm{set}} = 30Â° C\). In
                                (a) RH = 14%, in (b) RH = 24%, and in (c) RH =
                                34%. Figure courtesy of \cite{PREFrosting}. The
                                frost particles are the light turquoise and the
                                dry regions are black.

                    Understanding the mechanisms for frost formation is of
                    utmost importance to the global infrastructure because of
                    how much impact frosting has on crops, plumbing,
                    refrigerators, and HVAC systems. Understanding why and how
                    frost forms can help politicians develop strategies to
                    minimize the impact in cost that frost formation has on real
                    world systems. For example, ice impacts aviation,
                    telecommunications, electrical transmission, hydropower,
                    wind power, oil rigs and the transportation industries.
                    According to \cite{frostFormation}, frost accounts for 40%
                    of road accidents in winter, accumulation of frost on
                    refrigerators or heat exchangers decreases their efficiency
                    by as high as 50-75%, and wind turbines experience power
                    losses at about 50% with ice accretion.
