                        Throughout this paper, the underlying physics for frost
                        formation on a microstructured surface is explained.
                        Then two Monte-Carlo simulations of frost spreading on
                        micropillar surfaces were developed to recover
                        experimental results of frost formation in different
                        regimes of temperature and humidity. The first model was
                        inspired by Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) and send
                        out random walkers one at a time; the second model
                        vectorized this algorithm and sped up the computational
                        times for the pattern formation. Ultimately, the results
                        were able to replicate the experimental results in
                        different regimes by tweaking parameters that described
                        the probability of a random walker freezing or drying.
