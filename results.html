                    We run simulations for the original algorithm (which we will
                    call the simple algorithm) and the vectorized algorithm and
                    compare the two in this section. This is done first visually
                    and then by doing fractal analysis to calculate the fractal
                    dimension of the output from the two algorithms. In all of
                    the following graphics, <code>nx = ny
                    = 200</code>, <code> drying</code> and
                    <code> freezing</code> and noted in the
                    captions of the figures, \(N = 5000\) particles and
                    released, and \(n = 3000\) is lifespan of the random
                    walkers.

                    In Figures \ref{fig:dla_noah_compare} to \ref{fig:vec_5},
                    different results are shown for both of the algorithms. In
                    each of the captions, the specific values for
                    <code> freezing</code> and
                    <code> drying</code> are provided. There is
                    a sense of randomness in both of the algorithms, as the
                    random walkers are spawned from random locations and move in
                    random directions, however, more or less, it visually
                    appears that the results are similar. In Section
                    \ref{section:fracanalysis}, we go into more detail on the
                    fractal dimension for each of the algorithms using the two
                    previously defined fractal dimension algorithms (Section
                    \ref{section:fractalAnal}).

                    Although the results are not consistent between the two
                    methods that were used to calculate the fractal dimension,
                    they provide consistent results between two of the same runs
                    of the patterns that were developed in the simple and the
                    vectorized algorithms. The discrepancies between fractal
                    algorithms is not of too much concern since we were
                    attempting to show that the results between frosting
                    algorithms were consistent. This appears to be relatively
                    true. However, the slight changes between the numbers can be
                    due to a handful of reasons: for example, in some of the
                    simple algorithm runs, not all 5000 particles stuck,
                    therefore we were dealing with shapes of different relative
                    sizes. Furthermore, there is randomness inherent to both of
                    the algorithms and they will never be the exact same.
