                    Two different algorithms are used to analyze and extract the
                    fractal dimension \(d\) from the different frost crystals
                    created: 1. The Box-Counting Fractal Dimension Algorithm and
                    2. The Correlation Fractal Dimension Algorithm
                    \cite{corrFrac}. Even though each of these two algorithms
                    may appear similar, the fact that they are two different
                    algorithms at the core, leads to potentially different
                    results. Different fractal dimension algorithms are
                    well-known to give different but relatively close results,
                    which still makes them useful metrics for comparing many
                    different fractal patterns, including frost growth.

                    The Box-Counting Fractal Dimension Algorithm is a very
                    well-known algorithm for computing fractal dimensions (also
                    known as the Minkowski-Bouligand dimension). Here, the procedure
                    of the algorithm is simply laid out:
                </p>

                
                <ol width="50%">
                    <li>
                        Load data file: A matrix the size of the specified
                        domain, whereby each element is either a 0 if it
                        represents water, a 1 if it represents an ice
                        particle/region, and a 2 if it represents dry
                        particle/region. Note: Any element which contains a 2 is
                        removed, because only the fractal dimension of the frost
                        crystal is analyzed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Define several data resolutions \(s\)

                        <ul><li> The data resolution, \(s\), is a number between
                        \(0\) and \(1\), which is proportional to the number of
                        boxes (or pixels) that are used to 'visualize' all of
                        the data (\(s = 1\) is defined as the 'max resolution',
                        where a box simply covers an element in the matrix from
                        the data file). It is also inversely proportional to the
                        side length of each box (\(1/s\)), with the unit box
                        length taken to equal \(1\) to coincide with the max
                        resolution \(s = 1\).</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Count the number of boxes \(N(s)\)
                        programmatically for each data resolution \(s\)
                        
                        <ul><li> Starting with \(s = 1\), the number of boxes
                        \(N(1)\) is simply the number of ice particles in the data
                        file (i.e. summing all nonzero elements). For all other
                        \(s\), a new data matrix is created which is scaled by \(s\)
                        (the resolution). This new data matrix is created by
                        breaking up the main data file matrix into several \(1/s\)
                        by \(1/s\) matrices (which is done by using the 'conv2'
                        function on MATLAB, and removing any extra indices
                        created from the function). Any of these matrices which
                        simply contain one or more ice particles (element = 1),
                        is considered a box and counted. For each \(s\), \(N(s)\) is
                        recorded. Note: Any boundaries that stick out are simply
                        omitted.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Plot \(\ln{N}\) vs. \(\ln{s}\) and fit to a linear function:
                        The slope of this linear function gives the computed
                        fractal dimension \(d\).
