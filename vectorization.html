                    One important initiative that was taken to improve the
                    efficiency of the algorithm was vectorization. Vectorization
                    involves making use of arrays (and array operations) to have
                    multiple operations happen at once programmatically. This is
                    different from parallelization, which involves having
                    multiple operations run at the same time via multiprocessing
                    (distributing the processes on CPUs) and/or multithreading
                    (distributing the processes on several threads). While
                    parallelization can be more efficient since it separates
                    long-running processes into several short-running
                    subprocesses, vectorization was ultimately chosen to make
                    the algorithm more efficient. This is because
                    parallelization is best implemented when attempting to run
                    several `independent' subprocesses so that no overlaps or
                    `data races' occur, where two or more threads/CPUs are
                    running in the same process. In order to parallelize the
                    frosting model, multiple processes would have to be tracked
                    to ensure no overlapping, including the state of the frost
                    crystal and dry regions, the positions of all walkers, and
                    the radius of the circle at which walkers are released.
                    Vectorization allows for more efficiency and a way to
                    programmatically store the current states of the domain,
                    walkers, and radius, for every iteration.

                                Here is a plot of the time (minutes) each
                                algorithm (Single RW and Vectorized) takes to
                                complete for 6 different pairs of freezing
                                probabilities $p_{\text{ice}}$ and drying
                                probabilities $p_{\text{dry}}$.

                    Overall, some benefits of vectorization include more control
                    and flexibility, (generally) better efficiency, and (for
                    certain parameters) reproducibilty of the results from the
                    updated DLA algorithm. In fact, Figure
                    \ref{fig:comparingEfficiency} compares the amount of time it
                    takes to complete each algorithm (vectorized and
                    not-vectorized) for different pairs of fixed freezing and
                    drying probabilities, and for most probabilities (except
                    those near zero) the vectorized algorithm outperforms the
                    non-vectorized algorithm in efficiency. However, some
                    drawbacks include increased complexity, an exponential
                    decrease in efficiency for smaller freezing and drying
                    probabilities (as the figure also illustrates), and that
                    this vectorized algorithm is a slightly different process
                    from the updated DLA algorithm (which in fact must be
                    illustrated and shown to give similar results).

                                dry region (light cyan). The walkers all started
                                on the black dashed circle.

                    Figure \ref{fig:imageOfWalkers} gives an illustration of how
                    the vectorized walkers (magenta) move throughout a
                    fixed-size domain, and how they can create the frost regions
                    (dark cyan) and dry regions (light cyan) similar to the
                    previous algorithm that implements sticking probabilities
                    with DLA. The walkers all start on a circle of specified
                    radius to simulate coming from infinity (large relative to
                    the size of the frost domain), with all initial cell array
                    positions saved in a column array. In contrast to the
                    previous algorithm, the walkers are released at once, with
                    each walker still having a uniform chance of going into any
                    one of four coordinate directions (up/down/left/right) after
                    each iteration.

                    The vectorized walkers, walk, by updating the `walk'
                    function to take in the array of walker positions as input,
                    creating arrays for the x and y coordinates of these
                    positions, and adding either -1, 0, or 1 to each coordinate
                    such that each walker has a uniform probability of moving in
                    one of the four directions. Updating these coordinates for
                    every iteration is done with the following lines of MATLAB
                    code in the walk function. 
                    
                    \begin{lstlisting} 
                        rx = randi([-1 0],1,particles) + randi([0 1],1,particles);
                        
                        ry = zeros(1,particles);
                        ry(rx == 0) = randi([2 3],1,length( ry(rx == 0) ));
                        ry(ry == 2) = -1;
                        ry(ry == 3) = 1;
                        
                        xNew = x + rx;
                        yNew = y + ry;
                    \end{lstlisting}

                    This code creates a vector {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont rx}
                    with elements that have a 1/4 chance to be -1, 1/4 chance to
                    be +1, and a 1/2 chance to be 0. This also creates a vector
                    {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont ry} with elements that are 0 in
                    the {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont rx} vector having a 1/2
                    chance of becoming either 1 or -1, and the rest of the
                    elements in {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont ry} remaining zero
                    since they are -1 or 1 in {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont rx}
                    (i.e. the walker moved in an x-direction already). By then
                    adding {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont rx} to the x coordinates
                    and {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont ry} to the y coordinates,
                    all the walkers walk to their next position. Most
                    importantly, for each walker, the probability of moving left
                    (right) is 1/4 since each element in
                    {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont rx} has a 1/4 chance of being
                    -1 (+1), and the probability of moving down (up) is 1/4
                    since each element in {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont ry} has a
                    (1/2 times 1/2) chance of being -1 (+1). Overall, each
                    walker moves with uniform probability in one of the four
                    coordinate directions.

                    Overall, while a few changes have been made to the nature of
                    the previous process of sending a single walker out one at a
                    time, a few features of these vectorized walkers remain
                    unchanged. This includes that any walkers which move beyond
                    the boundaries of the domain are made to go to the other
                    opposite boundary. Also, any walkers which step into a
                    forbidden region (ice or dry) move back/stay at their
                    previous locations. Stepping into a forbidden region only
                    happens when one or more walkers are adjacent to this
                    region, do not become ice or dry, and then step into the
                    region.

                </header>
                <div class="section-content">
                    Whenever two or more walkers meet adjacent to the same ice
                    particle, the sticking probability is updated to include the
                    union probability of each walker sticking (i.e. if one
                    sticks they all stick). This is simply the probability that
                    at least one of $N$ walkers (that were adjacent) stick. 

                    The probability that none of $N$ walkers stick is modeled by
                    a binomial distribution with zero `successes' ($k = 0$) and
                    success probability $\mathbb{P}_f \equiv \text{Freezing
                    Probability}$, i.e. $\mathbb{P}_0 = {N \choose 0}
                    {\mathbb{P}_f}^0 (1 - \mathbb{P}_f)^{N-0} = (1 -
                    \mathbb{P}_f)^N$. Therefore, the probability that at least
                    one walker sticks is simply $1 - \mathbb{P}_0$, which gives
                    the new sticking probability $\mathbb{P}$ of taking all $N$
                    walkers together as one:

                    \begin{equation}\label{eq:stickProb}
                        \mathbb{P} = 1 - (1-\mathbb{P}_{f})^N 
                    \end{equation}

                    If this probability is satisfied, all the walkers stick. If
                    the probability is not satisfied, all the walkers also have
                    a probability to dry using the same probability model (with
                    $\mathbb{P}_f$ replaced by the fixed drying probability).
                    Otherwise, all walkers simply continue to walk together.
                    
                    The process of having walkers adjacent to the same ice
                    particle, either walk together as one (i.e. removing all
                    duplicate positions in the cell array) or stick with this
                    new union probability, was chosen over simply having any
                    walkers that stick, stick, and any walkers that do not
                    stick, continue to walk (of course also having the
                    probability to dry). This is because any of those walkers
                    that continue to walk, may walk further into the forbidden
                    region and get trapped, since any walker which moves into
                    the forbidden region must move back to its previous location
                    (but the previous location may now be part of the frost
                    domain). While the event that two or more walkers meet and
                    are adjacent to the same ice particle is rare, even when
                    thousands of walkers are released at once, this event is
                    still considered in order to programmatically avoid any
                    walkers being trapped within the forbidden regions. This is
                    also an example of dealing with overlapping processes
                    programmatically.

                <div class="section-content">
                    Consider a single random walker which moves on a 2D lattice.
                    Since moving up or right increases the Manhattan distance by
                    1 (and moving down or left by -1 respectively), a random
                    walk on a 2D lattice can be modeled (proportionally) by the
                    already well-established 1D random walk (which either moves
                    left or right with equal probability $\frac{1}{2}$). Let's
                    denote the position of this 1D walker after an $n$ number of
                    iterations as $x_n$. Also, let $s_i = 1$ if the step at
                    iteration $i$ was to the right, and let $s_i = -1$ if the
                    step at iteration $i$ was to the left.

                    The average distance this 1D walker travels $\langle x_n
                    \rangle$ is shown here,

                    \begin{equation}\label{eq:stickProb}
                         \langle x_n \rangle = \langle \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \langle s_i \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2}(-1) + \frac{1}{2}(1) = 0
                    \end{equation}

                    which is expected for a random walk which is equally likely
                    to move in any of two coordinate directions.
                    
                    The average squared distance of the 1D walker, on the other
                    hand, is not zero and is shown here.

                    \begin{multline}\label{eq:stickProb}
                         \langle {x_n}^2 \rangle = \langle \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} s_i s_j \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \langle {s_i}^2 \rangle + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j>i}^{n} \langle s_i s_j \rangle\\
                         = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac{1}{2}(-1)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(1)^2 \right) +\\ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j>i}^{n} \left( \frac{1}{4}(1)(1) + \frac{1}{4}(-1)(1) + \frac{1}{4}(1)(-1) + \frac{1}{4}(-1)(-1) \right) \\
                         = n + 0 = n
                    \end{multline}

                    Therefore, the root mean square (rms) of the distance for
                    the 1D walker (as well as proportionally to the vectorized
                    walkers on the 2D lattice) is $d = \sqrt{\langle x_N
                    \rangle} = \sqrt{N}$.
                    
                    To ensure that the code which creates and runs the
                    vectorized walkers still exhibit a diffusive nature, the
                    average distance a walker travels $d$ was compared with the
                    square root of the number of iterations $\sqrt{N}$, as the
                    number of iterations increases. These two variables should
                    tend to one another as $N$ approaches infinity, as developed
                    previously.

                    Figure \ref{fig:diffusionWalkers30} and Figure
                    \ref{fig:diffusionWalkers170} show the relative difference
                    between $d$ and $\sqrt{N}$ ($\text{Relative Difference} =
                    \frac{|d - \sqrt{N}|}{\sqrt{N}}$) for 5,000 vectorized
                    walkers which start on a circle of radius 30 and 170,
                    respectively. The standard domain of 401 by 401 is chosen
                    (200 from the origin on all sides), and there is no seed for
                    either radius because only the nature of the walkers is
                    being tested. As the plots show, while the relative
                    difference between $d$ and $\sqrt{N}$ does appear to be
                    increasing, it is relatively small with the average distance
                    never going beyond double $\sqrt{N}$ (i.e. the relative
                    difference remains below $1$). More importantly, the max
                    number of iterations for the walkers is usually fixed at
                    10,000, and as Fig.~(\ref{fig:diffusionWalkers30}) shows,
                    the relative difference remains quite small (below 0.25) for
                    the first 10,000 iterations. This is not the case for when
                    the radius is 170, which suggests that a smaller radius of
                    around 30 should initially be used (unless more iterations
                    are performed which could cost some extra time).

                    Figure \ref{fig:tooManyWalkers} demonstrates what happens
                    when too many walkers (5,000) are released within an initial
                    radius of 30, which eventually grows over time as the
                    crystal increases. Even though a smaller radius of around 30
                    should be used to effectively simulate walkers coming from
                    infinity, if a lot of walkers are spawned with a relatively
                    small region, they are biased to all stick to the seed at
                    once. This bias can be fixed by releasing a smaller number
                    of walkers in groups or `batches', while still starting with
                    an initially small radius of 30 that grows relative to the
                    size of the crystal, and such that the walker spawning
                    circle remains a distance of 30 from the crystal.

                    Figure \ref{fig:enoughWalkers} shows the crystal formed when
                    a more reasonable number of walkers are released per batch
                    (500) with the same initial radius of 30. As shown, the
                    crystal grows similar to the updated DLA-like growth
                    expected. A comparison of the results from both algorithms
                    (vectorized and not-vectorized) for different fixed freezing
                    and drying probability pairs, can be found in the Results
                    section.
                    
                    Overall, maintaining a small radius of 30 and releasing a
                    small number of walkers relative to the initial area within
                    the initial walker spawning circle, allows for the
                    vectorized walkers to effectively be used to create the
                    crystal in the most efficient and timely manner. Both
                    algorithms were worked on in parallel, and as discussed
                    previously, the results are compared in the Results section.
